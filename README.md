The goal of the game is to find all the mines within an MxN field. To help you, the game shows a number in a square which tells you how many mines there are adjacent to that square. 

For instance, take the following 4x4 field with 2 mines (which are represented by an * character):

*...
....
.*..
....

The same field including the hint numbers described above would look like this:

*100
2210
1*10
1110
